For as long as I can remember, I have made a conscious, daily effort to ensure that my siblings are never viewed through the lens of being "step" or "second-rate." To me, they are simply my siblings that I love more than my own heart. This is not a passive fact of biology; it is a bond I have actively nurtured and protected to ensure they never felt "othered." Two weeks ago, my sister turned to my mom, she thought I was out of earshot, and said “I don’t want Emmett to go to the peace corps. I don’t want Emmett time to be done.”

This inclusive definition of family is a core pillar of who I am, and because of that, our conversation felt like a fundamental violation of the values I hold most dear.

To put this in perspective, think of a tree where different branches were grafted together many years ago. Over time, the bark has grown over the joints, the rings of growth have become shared, and the same lifeblood pulses through the entire organism from a single root system. To the tree, it is one indivisible life. When you suggested holiday plans that pointedly excluded them and used labels like "half-siblings," it felt like a saw being held against those healed joints. It wasn't just a difference of opinion; it felt like an attempt to separate what I have worked my entire life to make whole.

That relational invalidation was the "ouch" I felt—the sharp sting of having a loved one try to redraw the boundaries of my heart to be smaller and less inclusive than the one I have built. The categorization of my siblings as "separate," nullified my reality and the sanctuary I’ve created for them.

Then, as we continued to discuss my hurt transformed into a more righteous verity of indignation. My chest heated up and began to pound. To me, labeling them as "half" or "step" is a demotion of their importance. Those terms felt like an affront to the years of love and effort I have poured into these relationships.

At the end there, I started to emotionally flood. My heart rate skyrocketed and an internal freak-out took hold as my nervous system shifted into a fight-or-flight state. I felt powerless to express myself as all words left my mind. 

This pressure manifested as protective grief. The urge to cry was not a sign of weakness, but a signal of the deep hurt and the fierce protection I feel for my family. It was the vulnerability of being misunderstood by someone who doesn't hold those same values, coupled with the weight of protecting a connection that matters more to me than words can say.

All this to say, my apologies for walking out on the conversation. Hopefully this is more articulate and helpful then I could have said in the moment and maybe it sheds some light on the connection and familial validity I feel for my siblings.
